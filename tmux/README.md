# Introducing TMUX 

With tmux you can become a total robotics power user. Tmux allows for creating multiple virtual terminals in one terminal screen.
Additionally, you can use it to remotely attach to and detach from terminal sessions. It's a must-have for field tests.

## Using tmuxp for even more configuration
Tmuxp is a tool that allows for loading tmux configurations. You can even create delays between panes being activated.
It's built on top of libtmux which is a Python library for interfacing with tmux. Consider using libtmux with ROS Python programs.
